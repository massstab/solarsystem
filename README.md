# Solarsystem Simulation
Simulates the solarsystem with a given set of real world initial conditions for the all the 8 planets and the sun. You can save a 2d plot or a animation of the inner and outer planets orbitting the sun. You can also animate the path (wobbling) of the sun due to the gravitational pull of the planets. It uses a leap frog for the numerical integration.
